# jarvis
Your smart Rust terminal with A.I. assistant.

Just git clone, cargo update, cargo run

It has 2 options:
- prefix any shell command with (!) and it will execute shell terminal Command
- Just type some question or anything and it will reach it's LLM
- You have to: export API_KEY="BIza3yBtoy2mFW-4AI6$3JPDNm-H1eijd5p$euEZ8" and Jarvis will automagically load it (in CAPS)

It's was just a concept to learn A.I. integration and learn Rust too, but I really got into it!
